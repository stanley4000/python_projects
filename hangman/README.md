This is a version of the classic game "Hangman" that can be played using Python version 3.

To start the game in the command line, enter <python3 main.py>.

At each stage of the game, simply type a letter to make a guess. If the letter is in the word, the letter will be displayed in the correct position and you'll be prompted to make another guess. If you guess an incorrect letter, a symbol will be added to the hangman's gallows and you'll be prompted to guess again. 

Your previous incorrect guesses will be displayed whenever you're prompted for a guess. If you make too many wrong guesses, the hangman image will be complete, and the game will end. You'll be prompted if you want to play again. Simply enter 'y' if you want to play, or any other character if you want to quit.
