Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 

All the predictions were unstable when run with fewer than 1000 simulations. 
The predicted members of the top five began to stabilize at 1000 simulations.
The order of results above sixth place began to stabilize with 10,000 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.

After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 
If precision across the whole list is necessary, it may be worth it to run 10,000 simulations, which took about .6 seconds longer than 1,000 sims.
However, if only the top predicted results are important (top five or fewer), then 1,000 simulations could be considered 'good enough'.
