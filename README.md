These are first draft versions of some projects I coded while learning python. 

Many of them are tasks from the App Brewery course "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023". Some others are from the Harvard/edX course "CS50" from 2023. 

I plan to revisit these soon, to add documentation as well as to improve or develop some of them further.
