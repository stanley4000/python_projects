These are first draft versions of some projects I coded while learning python. 

This collection also includes work using SQL, demonstrating some data analysis and work with databases. Some, but not all, of these projects involve the direct use of python.

Many of the projects here are tasks from two courses: the App Brewery course "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023", and the Harvard/edX course "CS50" from 2023. 

I plan to revisit these soon, to add documentation as well as to improve or develop some of them further.
