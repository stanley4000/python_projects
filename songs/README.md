The sql documents in this file are a series of queries that wrre created in response to the week 7 lab in Harvard's CS50 course:
https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/labs/7/

The queries were written to address questions related to the songs.db database, which contains information about Spotify's top 100 songs list from the year 2018. This database includes scores describing features such as danceability and energy for each of the tracks, and includes a table of the artists who are credited with each track. 

Each of the sql queries (1.sql - 8.sql) was created for sqlite3. They are designed to gather information such as the average energy of the whole list, as well as for songs by particular artists such as Post Malone and Drake. 

The answers.txt document includes some ideas for further analysis of the data, as well as limitatios of the analysis.
